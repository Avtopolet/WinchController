# WinchController
This is firmware for KT36/48ZWSR-SX02 e-bike controller for custom usage as winch motor controller.

Based on https://github.com/stancecoke/BMSBattery_S_controllers_firmware/tree/Master.

The main goal is to control the engine via UART from a computer (controller) with the possibility of smooth speed change and torque feedback.
